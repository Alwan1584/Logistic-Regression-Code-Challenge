# Logistic-Regression-Code-Challenge  
The Credit card approval dataset  from the UCI machine learning repositroy was used in this file.  
After data cleaning and preprocessing, the sklearn's logistic regression model was applied.  
The AUC - ROC curve was used as one of the perfomance measuring tools  
together with Accurcay, precision, recall and F1 score.
